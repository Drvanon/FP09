    abstractNote = {This volume brings together John von Neumann's long-out-of-print articles on computer architecture, programming, large-scale computing, and automata theory. A number of significant papers in these areas that were not included in the multivolume John von Neumann: Collected Works (1963) have now been reprinted here. These pioneering articles - written between the mid-1940s and the mid-1950s - are of enduring value not only to computer historians but to computer scientists at the vanguard of current research. Most of today's computers are still constructed in accordance with the '' von Neumann architecture,'' and his technique of flow charting remains basic in the domain.},

    abstract = "{Background: The specific resting metabolic rates (Ki; in kcal · kg−1 · d−1) of major organs and tissues in adults were suggested by Elia (in Energy metabolism: tissue determinants and cellular corollaries. New York, NY: Raven Press, 1992) to be as follows: 200 for liver, 240 for brain, 440 for heart and kidneys, 13 for skeletal muscle, 4.5 for adipose tissue, and 12 for residual organs and tissues. However, Elia's Ki values have never been fully evaluated.Objectives: The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the applicability of Elia's Ki values across adulthood and to explore the potential influence of age on the Ki values.Design: A new approach was developed to evaluate the Ki values of major organs and tissues on the basis of a mechanistic model: REE = ∑(Ki × Ti), where REE is whole-body resting energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry, and Ti is the mass of individual organs and tissues measured by magnetic resonance imaging. With measured REE and Ti, marginal 95\\% CIs for Ki values were calculated by stepwise univariate regression analysis. An existing database of nonobese, healthy adults [n = 131; body mass index (in kg/m2) \\&lt;30] was divided into 3 age groups: 21–30 y (young, n = 43), 31–50 y (middle-age, n = 51), and \\&gt;50 y (n = 37).Results: Elia's Ki values were within the range of 95\\% CIs in the young and middle-age groups. However, Elia's Ki values were outside the right boundaries of 95\\% CIs in the \\&gt;50-y group, which indicated that Elia's study overestimated Ki values by 3\\% in this group. Age-adjusted Ki values for adults aged \\&gt;50 y were 194 for liver, 233 for brain, 426 for heart and kidneys, 12.6 for skeletal muscle, 4.4 for adipose tissue, and 11.6 for residuals.Conclusion: The general applicability of Elia's Ki values was validated across adulthood, although age adjustment is appropriate for specific applications.}",

        abstract = {Tissue maceration was used to determine the absolute number and the distribution of cell types in Hydra. It was shown that the total number of cells per animal as well as the distribution of cells vary depending on temperature, feeding conditions, and state of growth. During head and foot regeneration and during budding the first detectable change in the cell distribution is an increase in the number of nerve cells at the site of morphogenesis. These results and the finding that nerve cells are most concentrated in the head region, diminishing in density down the body column, are discussed in relation to tissue polarity.},
